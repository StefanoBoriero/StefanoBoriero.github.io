But it poked my interest a bit, so I decided to give it a try and see what I can learn about it in a short time. It&amp;rsquo;s a rainy Sunday, so it seems like a perfect day to concentrate and take a deep dive on the topic. Ideally I&amp;rsquo;d want to be able to deploy a couple of services in Kubernetes and have them communicate with each other.</description></item></channel></rss>
