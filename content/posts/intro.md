Hello there, welcome! You migth be wondering why does this corner of the web exist: let me try to answer the question.  
I had the idea of creating a personal page in the back of my mind for a long time, mostly because I wanted to establish a stronger online presence than my empty LinkedIn profile. I wanted something that could represent me better than a CV, but that also would require little maintenance on my side.  
On another note, I feel like I learn a lot of interesting things in my daily endevours and I would like to formalise these learnings in a written form to serve 2 main purposes:
* Clarify the mess in my head: the best way to know if you understood something, is to explain it to someone else, even if imaginary
* Share my learnings with the community: my opinions might be not very useful on their own, but ideas often are born by connecting the dots in your head. I hope the content you'll find here will prove useful and sparkle something bigger

So I finally decided to take the leap and start! I'm still not clear about the final destination of this project, but sometimes you have to _just do it_.

# What will be the content of this website?

Literally anything, I don't want to be constrained to any topic. It will mostly be about personal projects and learnings that I find useful. Or maybe some cooking recipes, who knows.
