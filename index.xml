&lt;p>This document explains Service Level Objectives (SLOs), a monitoring practice aimed at ensuring systems provide an acceptable level of service. As with any practice, it won&amp;rsquo;t make systems reliable on its own; developers need to follow it consistently for it to be fruitful. It requires discipline and time to become familiar with it, but it&amp;rsquo;s a rewarding journey that you can add to your CV. If you&amp;rsquo;re passionate about the topic, feel free to read the complete &lt;a href="https://sre.google/books/">Google SRE books&lt;/a>; if not, we&amp;rsquo;ll link specific chapters in the following paragraphs that will give you a good grasp of the subject.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A day in Kubernetes</title><link>https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/a-day-in-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/a-day-in-kubernetes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recentely I was asked if I had any experience in Kubernetes: well, long story short, I don&amp;rsquo;t :)&lt;/p>

It&amp;rsquo;s a rainy Sunday, so it seems like a perfect day to concentrate and take a deep dive on the topic. Ideally I&amp;rsquo;d want to be able to deploy a couple of services in Kubernetes and have them communicate with each other.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why does this webiste exist?</title><link>https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/intro/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/intro/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello there, welcome! You migth be wondering why does this corner of the web exist: let me try to answer the question.&lt;br>
I had the idea of creating a personal page in the back of my mind for a long time, mostly because I wanted to establish a stronger online presence than my empty LinkedIn profile. I wanted something that could represent me better than a CV, but that also would require little maintenance on my side.&lt;br>
On another note, I feel like I learn a lot of interesting things in my daily endevours and I would like to formalise these learnings in a written form to serve 2 main purposes:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stefanoboriero.github.io/posts/about/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="about-myself">About myself&lt;/h1>
